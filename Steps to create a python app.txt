The code you provided is not a complete web application. It is a Python script that prompts users with a list of survey questions, collects their responses, and stores the data in a Pandas DataFrame before saving it to a CSV file. However, this code can be integrated into a web application to collect survey data from users via a web form.

Here's an overview of how you can develop a web application that uses this Python script:

1. Define the purpose and scope of your web application.
2. Design the user interface for the web form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Use a web framework like Flask or Django to create the backend of your web application.
4. Integrate the Python code you provided into the backend of your web application.
5. Set up a database to store survey responses, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
6. Modify the Python script to write survey data to the database instead of a CSV file.
7. Deploy the web application to a web server or cloud platform.
8. Monitor and maintain the web application to ensure it runs smoothly and securely.

To accomplish the above, here's a more detailed breakdown of the steps:

1. Define the purpose and scope of your web application: Determine the specific goal of your web application, identify your target audience, and create a plan for how you will collect, store, and analyze survey data.

2. Design the user interface for the web form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Create a web form that includes the survey questions you want to ask users, as well as any other information you need to collect, such as user demographics or contact information.

3. Use a web framework like Flask or Django to create the backend of your web application: A web framework provides you with a set of tools and libraries that allow you to build web applications quickly and efficiently. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework, while Django is a more robust framework that provides more built-in functionality.

4. Integrate the Python code you provided into the backend of your web application: You can add the code you provided to the backend of your web application by creating a function that prompts users for survey responses and saves the data to a database.

5. Set up a database to store survey responses: You can use a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to store survey data. You'll need to create a database schema that defines the tables and columns where survey data will be stored.

6. Modify the Python script to write survey data to the database instead of a CSV file: You can modify the code you provided to use SQL queries to insert survey data into the database.

7. Deploy the web application to a web server or cloud platform: You'll need to choose a hosting service that meets the requirements of your web application and deploy your code to the server.

8. Monitor and maintain the web application to ensure it runs smoothly and securely: You'll need to monitor your web application for errors, update your code as needed to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, and perform regular backups of your database.
